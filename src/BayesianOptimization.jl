Provides a really simple implementation of Bayesian Optimization
for black box function. The current implementation is loosely based
off of [this](https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization) python library.

TODO: This could probably be setup to implement the

SolverInterface, but for now I'm going to leave this as is.
